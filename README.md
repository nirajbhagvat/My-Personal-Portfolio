# Cloud Resume Challenge 🚀

This repository contains the source code and configuration for my **Cloud Resume Challenge** project. The challenge involves creating a dynamic, cloud-hosted resume using various AWS services, CI/CD automation, and modern web development practices.

## Project Overview 🌐

The **Cloud Resume Challenge** showcases a resume website hosted on AWS, with dynamic features like a visitor counter stored in DynamoDB. This project also implements a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment to an S3 bucket. The project was published by Forrest Brazeal.

### Key Features

- **Frontend**: A simple, responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript resume website.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Website hosted on a private **Amazon S3** bucket, distributed via **CloudFront**.
- **Visitor Counter**: A **DynamoDB** table tracks the number of website visits, with a **Lambda function** updating the counter.
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployments from GitHub to S3 using **GitHub Actions**.
